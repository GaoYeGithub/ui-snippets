## Inspiration
A react app to store web design components for developers and designers. allowing them to quickly visualize and implement CSS.

## What it does
My project provides a collection of CSS snippets for UI components. With a live IDE where users can preview, customize, and copy code snippets for use in their projects.

## How I built it
I mostly used React, & tailwind css. With live web ide feature that renders CSS and HTML components, allowing users to see their changes in real time. The project is hosted on a vercel.

## Challenges We ran into
I struggled with makeing the live web IDE to start with the components. As well as intrgrateing a preview that led to alot of bugs.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The button shadow on hover effect, the wave animation, and the glass effect are standout features that add significant visual appeal. Also, successfully building a dynamic live IDE for previewing CSS was a major accomplishment.

## What I learned
I learned how to integrate dynamic rendering in React, and left click and react rounter functionailty.

## What's next for CSS Snippets Library
Expand the library with even more unique CSS styles.
Enable users to save and share their customizations.
Tailwind, SCSS and bootstrap version.
